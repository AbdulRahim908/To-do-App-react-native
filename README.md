## This is a React Native application for a simple ToDo app. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Here's a breakdown of the code:

State Variables:

task: Holds the current task being inputted in the TextInput.
tasks: An array that holds all the tasks.
editIndex: Keeps track of the index of the task being edited. -1 means no task is currently being edited.
Event Handlers:

handleAddTask: Adds a new task to the tasks array. If editIndex is not -1, it updates the existing task.
handleEditTask: Sets the task to the selected task for editing and updates the editIndex.
handleDeleteTask: Deletes a task at the specified index.
Render Item Function:

renderItem: Renders each task item in a FlatList with "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
UI Components:

TextInput: Allows users to input tasks.
TouchableOpacity: Used for the "Add Task"/"Update Task" button and "Edit" and "Delete" buttons for each task.
FlatList: Renders the list of tasks.
Styles:

Styles are defined using the StyleSheet.create method for various components, including the container, title, input, buttons, and individual task items.
Export:

The App component is exported as the default export.
This code demonstrates a basic ToDo app with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality in React Native. Users can input tasks, edit them, and delete them. The styling is done using the StyleSheet.create method to keep the styles organized. The code uses functional components and hooks, such as useState. The app has a simple and clean design with a heading, title, input field, and a list of tasks with corresponding buttons for editing and deleting.
